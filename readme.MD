## Aditionals

Additionally, I developed an API for make the processing of the multiplication tables.

Obviously, don't makes sense make an API for that simple task, but I wanted to try develop one with Node.js. The link to the API [is here](https://multiplication-table-api.herokuapp.com)


I hope you enjoy it! ðŸ™Œ
